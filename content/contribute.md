Oh man, it would be awesome if you felt like helping out!

If you ever try out Noddity as a blog-thing or a wiki-thing somewhere, or install it and poke out it, just tell me how it worked in your use case (or what broke, or what was dumb) and that would be sweet.

The [Github repo is over here](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity) - if you spot any bugs, you can make a pull request if you feel so inclined, or even just [report the issue](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity/issues) so that I know about it.

If you have any features requests/restructuring that you think is in line with the spirit of the project, let me know, I would love feedback from other developers!  Ping me on Twitter at [TehShrike](https://twitter.com/TehShrike), or send me an email at <a href="mailto:me@JoshDuff.com">me@JoshDuff.com</a>.
